			"text": "There are different ways we can\napproach transforming and\ninnovating the world of work\ntogether.",
			"text1": "And these paths can sometimes feel like a maze. We know this because we too found ourselves working on a project where we often felt overwhelmed or lost along the way. The emotional roller coaster was part of the process, as was the joy and happiness at having achieved something at the end.",
			"text2": "But we also realized that working as a team on a project is a constant test. After all, it is important to stand for your own interests, but also to work as a collective. That takes strength.",
			"text3": "Our way through was to work with our emotions and to achieve more and more clarity through communication and the targeted use of different methods. But access to external support in the form of coaching and facilitation also helped us to regain our strength. In turn, this allowed us to integrate and apply what we had learned in our everyday work and to focus on our vision."
